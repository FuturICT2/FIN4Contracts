## Try it out

The live deployment is located at:
`http://ec2-18-209-102-101.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000`

Set up your MetaMask extension to point to the AVADO "Ethereum Goerli testnet node". If you are in the Trust Square network, use `http://172.20.0.103:8545`, otherwise `http://62.12.152.38:8548`.

Make sure you have some Goerli Ether by using your MetaMask account address in the Goerli-faucet: `https://goerli-faucet.slock.it`
